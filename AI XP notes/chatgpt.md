# Notes on Using ChatGPT
___

During my learning journey, I started using ChatGPT quite early. It began with what I call "vibe coding" — generating scripts for various creative ideas that quickly spiraled into massive projects, often beyond my then-current Python skills.

A couple of years ago, I spoke with a client who worked in IT. She said something that stuck with me:  
> *“Google gives you knowledge, but it doesn’t always give you the **how-to**.”*

That quote perfectly described how I felt using AI at first. While GPT could generate ideas and code, it often lacked the context or scaffolding I needed to actually **understand** what I was working with. Eventually, I shifted my approach — moving from "vibe coding" to using AI more like a **quiz generator**, **tutor**, or **lecture translator**.

## Benefits I Found

### Faster Learning (30–40%)
When following courses (Python, networking, etc.), combining them with GPT support helped speed up my learning significantly. If a lecturer’s explanation didn’t click, GPT could usually **rephrase** it in a way that made personal sense to me.

### Staying Focused
One key insight: keep chats focused.  
Avoid jumping between too many topics in one thread — it dilutes the quality of the responses.

### Clarity, Motivation & Structure
When I had a vague idea or hit a creative slump, GPT helped me:
- **Clarify my thoughts**
- **Break big ideas into smaller parts**
- **Push through procrastination or overwhelm**

GPT became like a **thinking partner** — helping me process chaotic thoughts and turn them into structured goals.

## Final Thoughts

GPT is powerful — but it works best when treated as a **supplement**, not a lifeline.

Use it to:
- Supplement your own learning
- Test your understanding
- Organize and accelerate your thinking

But don't rely on it completely. Mastery still comes from putting in the work yourself.
