# purplePath 
A Cybersecurity Journey (Red, Blue, and Purple Team + AI)

Welcome to **purplePath**, my personal roadmap through the world of cybersecurity.  
This repository documents my **daily learning**, **hands-on labs**, **tools**, and **scripts** as I move through networking, Linux, offensive and defensive security — with a growing focus on **automation and AI-powered security workflows**.

> Think of this as an evolving blend of notebook, cheatsheet, lab report, and script vault — everything built from scratch, updated regularly.
