# purplePath 
A Cybersecurity Journey (Red, Blue, and Purple Team + AI)

Welcome to **purplePath**, my personal roadmap through the world of cybersecurity.  
This repository documents my **daily learning**, **hands-on labs**, **tools**, and **scripts** as I move through networking, Linux, offensive and defensive security — with a growing focus on **automation and AI-powered security workflows**.

> Think of this as an evolving blend of notebook, cheatsheet, lab report, and script vault — everything built from scratch, updated regularly.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is actively growing. I add new scripts, walkthroughs, tool breakdowns, and AI experiments as I learn and practice.

Currently building toward:
- Metasploit payload automation
- Python + AI log summarizers
- Offensive security + stealth testing
- Defensive alerting and intrusion detection scripts

---

## Purpose

This project exists to:
- Track and document my **cybersecurity growth**
- Act as an extension of my **technical CV**
- Show real-world thinking in **problem solving, tool creation, and workflow design**
- Eventually evolve into a reference for **fellow learners, job reviewers, and collaborators**
