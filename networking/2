a small [[network]] would only need to consist of 2 devices

UTP == unshielded twisted pair

ethernet network involves a wired connection

MAC == Media Access Control

Airdrop creates it's own wifi network that allows two devices to share files without the 
need for any other wifi network

modulation == * the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the 
              carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information 
              to be transmitted.
              * most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation(FM) or 
              amplitude modulation(AM) for radio broadcast
