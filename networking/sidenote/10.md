# IPv4, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway – Easy Summary

## IP Address (IPv4)
- Think of this as your **device’s phone number** on the network.
- Example: `192.168.1.10`
- It's **unique** to each device on the local network.

---

## Subnet Mask
- This tells your device which part of the IP address is the **network portion** and which part is the **host (device number)**.
- Example: `255.255.255.0` → `/24`
    - First 3 octets (192.168.1) = **Network**
    - Last octet (.10) = **Host**
- The subnet mask controls how big or small the network is.

## Subnet Breakdown Example (/24):
- **Network Address**: `192.168.1.0`
- **First Usable IP**: `192.168.1.1`
- **Last Usable IP**: `192.168.1.254`
- **Broadcast Address**: `192.168.1.255`

---

# Default Gateway
- Think of this as the **exit door** or **router** that connects your device to other networks (like the internet).
- Example: `192.168.1.1`
- Your device sends traffic here if it’s trying to reach **outside the subnet**.

---

# Why 255.255.255.0 (/24) is Easy
- It uses 24 bits for the network and 8 bits for hosts.
- 8 host bits → `2^8 - 2 = 254` usable IPs
- Easy to recognize:
    - Network = first 3 octets
    - Host = last octet

| IPv4 Address    | Your device’s phone number           | Unique identifier on the network                              |
| Subnet Mask     | Tells what part is the network       | Defines the split between network and host bits               |
| Default Gateway | Router’s IP, your way out            | IP address your device uses to reach other networks           |
| /24 Mask        | First 3 = network, last = host       | 255.255.255.0 = 24 network bits, 8 host bits                  |

# Tips for Studying
- Practice subnetting with /24, /25, /26, and /27 first.
- Use [subnetting.org](https://subnetting.org) for daily drills.
- Memorize the powers of 2 table: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
