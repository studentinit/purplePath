what is a [[network]]?

a computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes.
which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media.
such as twisted pair or fibre-optic cables, or by wireless methods such as wifi, microwave transmission,
or free-space optical communication.

why do we have computer networks?
the answer is in the definition above [sharing resources]
sneakernet is the old way where you copy a file on a floppy-disk, walk to a printer or someone else's 
computer and give the floppy-disk to them. (not scalable)

what is a node?
a computing device[laptops, phones, printers etc.]
in networking we have specialized devices as well[hubs, switches, routers, firewals etc.]

what is a data limk?
physical cable such as twisted pair, fibre-optic, wifi or some type of link that allow sharing of 
resources

###################
SUMMARY:
rather than having to physically transporting a floppy-disk or usb drive with resources on it from A to B,
we use a cable or some kind of mechanism to trasport the resource faster and with less effort
