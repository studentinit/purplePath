can be divided into smaller subnetworks/hosts (over 16 000 000)

class b has 16 382 different networks
65 534 different subnetworks/ hosts

class c has 2 097 150 networks

class d = multi-cast
cant use

class e = mysterious and untouchable networks and hosts
experimental
cant use

127.0.0.0 is missing from chart.
for loopback addresses
over 16 000 000 addresses
used for network testing
virtual addresses on your computer
ping 127.0.0.1 is basically pinging your own device

IPV4  has b4 m294 t967 296 possible ip addresses (not enough anymore)
