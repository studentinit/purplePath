IPv4 = Internet Protocol version 4

IPv6 = Internet Protocol version 6

TCP  = Transmission Control Protocol

UDP  = User Datagram Protocol

RFC = Request for Comments

    - A type of document that describes standards and protocols

    - Often published by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) or IRTF (nternet research task force)


in telecommunication, A communication protocol is a system of rules that allow devices to exchange data.

It defines:

    - Syntax (structure)

    - Semantics (meaning)
    
    - Synchronization (timing)
    
    - Error detection/recovery methods

tcp/ip

Application     > HTTP, HTTPS, Telnet, FTP, TFTP

Transport       > TCP, UDP

Network         > Routers operate here (IP)

Data Link       > Switches and Bridges operate here (MAC addresses)

Physical        > Hubs, Cables, Wi-Fi signals (raw bit transmission)


when data is sent at the physical layer(layer 1) we are sending 0 and 1(known as bits)
0 or 1 will represent our bits

if light == True

    print(1)

if light == False

    print(0)


tcp/ip

application = [data]

transport = [segments]

network = [packets]     # a router will route packets from 1 interface to another

data link = [framse]    # a switch will switch data from one port to another

physical = [bits]       # a wire/cable will ransport bits from one end to the other
