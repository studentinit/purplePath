osi model is more real world
tcp/ip model is more relevent and compact in regards to studying for ccna. like a hybrid model.
layer 1-4 is especially important for individuals working in networking.


| OSI Layer (7 Layers)  | TCP/IP Model Layer | Description                         |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 7. Application        | 4. Application     | User interface, email, HTTP, etc.   |
| 6. Presentation       | 4. Application     | Data formatting (e.g., encryption)  |
| 5. Session            | 4. Application     | Session control, connections        |
| 4. Transport          | 3. Transport       | TCP/UDP, segmentation                |
| 3. Network            | 2. Internet        | IP addressing, routing              |
| 2. Data Link          | 1. Network Access  | MAC addresses, switching             |
| 1. Physical           | 1. Network Access  | Cables, NICs, signals               |


Notes:
- OSI = Conceptual and layered for teaching.
- TCP/IP = Real-world, practical model used in networking (and CCNA).
- TCP/IP is like a **compressed hybrid** of OSI.
- Layers 1â€“4 in OSI are **most important for networking roles**.
