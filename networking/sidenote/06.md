routing, intelligence based on ip address
switching intelligence based on MAC

attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal. the longer the distance, the weaker the signal

what is a repeater?:
repeaters would repeat(boost) signal.
not designed to understand the signal, just amplify it.

what is a Hub?
A hub is essentially a multi-port repeater
again, does not understand the frames it receives, but simply amplifies it.
layer 1 devices
a wirelesss acces point is esssentially a modern Hub

what is a switch? 
a switch has intelligence. it reads the frames receives on ethernet.
it ensures that the frames are sent only on the relevent ports to the relevent MAC
works on layer 2
used in LAN(local area network)

what is a brdge?
it is an intermediate device between a switch and a Hub
bridge = learns MAC addresses in software.
switch = learns MAC addresses much faster by using hardware ASICs(Application Specific Integrated Circuits)

so historically we had:
repeaters
Hubs
bridges
switches 

what is a router?
works on layer 3
allows us to route from one network to another. LAN TO WAN
WAN = wide are network is a telecommunications network that ectends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking


a layer 3 switch has routing capabilities as well
VLAN = virtual local area network
