[[network]]
two main devices to be aware of(initially)
server + client

what is a server?
in computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for 
other programs or devices, called "clients".
this architecture is called the client-server model, and a single overall computation is 
distibuted across multiple processes or devices.

so, a server is a provider for a client(service or functionality)

what is a client?
a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.
the server is often on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of 
a network

so basicaly a server is a supplier, and a client is a receiver.
a lapto can also act as a host(server)
a website will serve a webpage to a client

API == application programming interface

######################################

ports + protocols
what is a protocol?
it is basically a set of rules, used for communication between devices

#####################
SUMMARY:
server == apartment building
client == visitor
port == room number
protocol == language spoken in the room
ip address == street address of building
dns (domain name system) == phone book translating names to address
hacker == visitor with hidden agenda(good or bad)
